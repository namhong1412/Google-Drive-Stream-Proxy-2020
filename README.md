# Welcome to Google Drive Stream Proxy 2020!

This is a perfect way to replace hiring video hosting services (`in a certain perspective`)

Can say it is `Alternative Google Drive Streaming - Kaido Drive Script`

## Highlights 🔥

You just need to send `ID_VIDEO_DRIVE`, the script will automatically return you the `RESULTS` you want, you don't need to update the `RESULTS` from your `ID_VIDEO_DRIVE`. Every time you use, if the `RESULT` is older than 3 hours ago, it will be automatically update.

## Installation

Clone this repository and upload it to your hosting or VPS/DEDICATED. Please chmod 777 for the directory it is in so it can work.


## Usage 🚀
- The video stored on your drive must be set to `anyone with the link can see it`.

- You can view the script by `drive.php?id=[ID_VIDEO_DRIVE]`

## Requirements to script service install

- VPS/DEDICATED clean with root password
- SUBDOMAIN or DOMAIN pointed to ip of VPS
